# Quantum Code Challenge: Swapping Values of  N Qubits 👨🏻‍💻
---


The swap operation is crucial for rearranging qubit states and implementing various quantum algorithms. 

Your task is to generate a function that handles an N value of qubits, each holding a specific quantum state. You need to rearrange these qubit states using the swap function . 

# Example:
How would you write the code that utilizes the swap function to flip the values of these 4 qubits? 

the initial value would be 1100

the flipped value after the implementation : 0011
